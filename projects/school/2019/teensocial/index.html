								<h2>Feeling addicted?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>If you spend hours and hours on social media like Instagram and Snapchat just scrolling down endlessly looking at everything, you are probably addicted. Many studies show that social media addiction can lead to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Overuse of social media and technology stimulates the "reward" pathway in your brain, caused by how many followers/likes you have.</p>

								<h2>Social media can be unsafe</h2>
							</header>
							<p>If you haven't been cyberbullied online yet, you don't really know what it's like or what you go through. Bullies online can be anyone; a stranger, someone from your school or even your friend.</p>
							<p>Most people who have hundreds or even thousands of followers don't know most of them. That can be one cause to being unsafe online, because if you are a child, preditors might be stalking your profile and maybe even messaging you right now. You can start by maybe putting your account on private or modifying your privacy settings so you are protected from strangers.</p>
							<p>I know you might be saying, "I know all of my followers! I'm not going to edit my privacy settings just because this one website says to.." But trust me, you won't regret it. Being cyberbullied is not good because it can make you feel like harming yourself or making you feel worthless. If you or someone you know are being affected by cyberbullied, you can go to <a href="https://www.stymie.com.au">Stymie to make a notification</a> or <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/reportcyberbullying">report cyberbullying on the eSafety website</a>.</p>

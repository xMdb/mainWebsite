									<h2 class="major">The Start of the Story</h2>
									<p>BANG! I slammed the door of our hotel door open, longing to get into my PJs and hit that sweet, sweet mattress. We walked like zombies the whole day around the massive city of New York. I hear the toilet make a weird clunking noise. “Yikes, that doesn’t sound good.” I said to my family. </p>

									<p>The toilet soon started to bubble and ooze out disgusting toilet water. It dripped down like icicles melting onto the slippery floor. It smelt like rotten eggs and spoilt milk… but 100 times worse. “Quick, grab those towels!” declared Mum. I began slipping in the water while desperately trying to grab some towels. We could use them to block off water from entering the hallway, but it was too late.</p>

									<p>We were on the 24th floor, and water was trickling into the hallway slowly. The smell was getting worse. We pinched our noses and bordered ourselves in the living room. Our faces were white as ghosts, and filled with horror, as the sickening sludge flooded the room. We desperately called the receptionist, but no-one picked up. It was in the late hours of the night. Why does the toilet hate us? It was like magic. The toilet did indeed, hate us. It wanted us dead. I began to feel sick, and I was about to throw up. The muck flooded the rooms below ours like a tsunami.</p>

									<p>The water was quickly reaching our ankles. Our luggage has already been wrecked in the water. All our belongings, drowning in the water. Our screams echoed through-out the halls. Suddenly, someone heard us. They sprinted towards our room and opened the door. Big mistake. The water flooded out into the halls, washing everything away with it. The guy screamed. “What the hell? What’s happening?!” as he was being washed away.</p>

									<p>Hours later, we were still helplessly screaming. Water was everywhere. Everything, including the hallways, were flooded. I decided to go out into the wild and find something to drink for everyone, as we were all parched. We didn’t feel like drinking the toilet water. I trudged through the muck and opened the fridge. We didn’t have anything in there yet. Drat. I ran to the other room to search for anything that wasn’t destroyed. I made a trudging sound as I walked. Then, I slipped. My legs gave way. I fell with a loud “OOF” and dropped to the floor. Water splashed everywhere. I almost drowned in the muck. My hand was now broken, because of all the weight I had put on it. I couldn’t move. Everything went black. </p>

							<p>W-where am I? How long have I been… asleep?” I stuttered. “Don’t worry about that.” The man in the corner of the room added, which I assume was the doctor taking care of me. “I’m Brett, the senior doctor here. We need to find out what happened. Do you remember anything about what happened yesterday?” he asked. I could swear I could remember a tsunami pushing against me. A tidal wave… yes, that was it!</p>

							<p>“The toilet in our hotel room flooded! I was running to the other side of the room, and I guess I had a hard fall.” Dr. Brett was somewhat relieved. “Even though you don’t have any concussions, you are still going to need surgery for your hand. You fractured it 4 different ways.” He said with a sigh. “I broke my hand that seriously?” I curiously asked. “Yes, but don’t mov-“ Too late. Tears were welling up. The world was filled with pain. What did I do to deserve this?</p>

							<p>The world was soon filled with blood and pain. I can’t feel my arm. I can feel it even when I’m asleep. It was like 99 gigantic elephants jumped on my arm. Blood was flooding the room like a tidal wave, and I begin to wake up. I woke up later with a blaring light in my face. The surgery was finished. “You knocked yourself out by moving your hand, didn’t you?” laughed the operator. </p>

						<p>“Don’t worry, people have done that all the time.” I got up and saw my mum in the hallway. My hand still hurting like hell. I gave her a big hug. We were going to return home safe. I learnt that if you are in darkness, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, no-matter where you can be. You just can’t give up hope. Where would have I been if I gave up?</p>

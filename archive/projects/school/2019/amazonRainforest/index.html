				<h3>Statement of Findings</h3>
				<p>The Amazon is a rainforest that spans 6.7 million square kilometres. It is currently the largest rainforest
					biome on the Earth and is twice the size of India (Rainforest Cruises, 2017, WWF, 2005). It also contains
					the Amazon river, which flows for more than 6,600km and counts for 15-16% of the world's total river
					discharge into the ocean.</p>

							<h4>Species in the Amazon</h4>
							<p>The massive rainforest itself contains 390 billion individual trees and 16,000 different species of
								tree (Eureka Alert, 2013). It contains roughly 13% of the 3 trillion trees the Earth houses (Geography
								Realm, 2015). It also has other biomes, like savanna, floodplain forests, grasslands, swamps, bamboos
								and palm forests. (Mongabay, 2019)</p>

						<div class="inner" id="location">
							<h4>Location of Biome</h4>
							<p>The Amazon spans over 8 different countries and 6.7 million square kilometres, but the forest is mostly
								in Brazil and Peru. Brazil takes 64% coverage, Peru takes 10%, Columbia takes 6% and Bolivia takes 6% of
								coverage of the Amazon rainforest, with the other percentage being other countries (World Atlas, 2017).
								Usually tourists who want to explore the rainforest will base themselves in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and
								Ecuador, as you are only permitted entry into the forest with a tour guide (Rainforest Cruises, 2017).

							<h4>Rainforest climate</h4>
							<p>The Amazon rainforest is also very close to the equator, making the rainforest climate hot and damp
								(Active Wild, 2015). Other significant rainforests around the world is the Congo Rainforest in central
								Africa and the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest on the west coast of southern South America. (Conserve
								Energy Future, 2019)</p>

						<div class="inner" id="threats">
							<h4>Significant Threats and Conservation Efforts</h4>
							<p>The Amazon rainforest is currently under threat because of deforestation and multiple wildfires
								happening within the forest. Since the 1950s, 17% of the Amazon's trees have been cut down to clear land
								for more livestock and other properties (World Bank, 2013). The wildfires have also been more prominent
								in the recent years, and recently there were an outburst of even more fires. This is a problem because
								the Amazon rainforest provides over 20% of the Earth’s total oxygen (Newsweek, 2019).</p>

						<div class="inner">
							<p>At one point, more
								than 40,000 fires were burning inside the Amazon. They were mostly all manmade fires and began spreading
								from there, as the reason these fires started is because of bad farming practices. This is done
								regularly to burn through newly felled forests that have been cleared to make way for pastures and
								burning them boosts the nutrients in the soil (ABC News, 2019). This cycle is alarming scientists,
								because the forest is close to an irreversible state (The Guardian, 2019, National Geographic, 2019). It
								also is destroying many animal habitats and destroying plant life. Consequences for loss of habitat can
								include endangerment or extinction of a species.</p>

					<h3>Recommendations</h3>
					<h4>ARPA</h4>
				</header>
				<p>In 2002, Brazil launched the biggest forest conservation effort in history, known as the Amazon Region
					Protected Areas (ARPA). The goal is to take hundreds of millions of acres of the Amazon and turn it into
					sustained-use and strict protected areas, which is a huge task. In over a decade, the ARPA has protected a
					California-sized area of the Amazon already. The ARPA’s conservation efforts have helped dramatically with
					deforestation, and they are looking to provide ongoing protection for the 30 million people living in the
					Amazon as well as all of the different species of animal and plant. (WWF, 2014)</p>
				<header class="major">
					<h4>One Tree Planted</h4>
				</header>
				<p>One Tree Planted is an organisation that started in 2014, focusing on planting trees in many locations
					including the Amazon Rainforest. According to Taviana MacLeod, an employee from One Tree Planted, they would
					have planted close to 700,000 trees in the Amazon (Refer to Appendix 3). The reforestation project is located
					in the Madre de Dios region in Peru. Hosting a population of over 140,000 (citypopulation.de, 2017), it is
					very dense with biodiversity, as it is home to never-ending forests, winding rivers and abundant wildlife
					(Peru Travel, 2014). Planting more trees increase oxygen levels, give animals more opportunities for habitats
					and slowly decrease the climate change epidemic that is ongoing.</p>
				<header class="major">
					<h4>Chosen Recommendation</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The best solution to this problem is to plant more trees, as we are losing so many trees across all of the
					world’s forests. One Tree Planted is one of the many companies/charities that plants trees around the globe.
					The popular “Team Trees” collaboration between many YouTubers, started by YouTubers MrBeast and Mark Rober,
					with their mission to plant 20,000,000 trees. </p><img src="images/teamtrees.png" alt="" />
				<p><br>Team Trees partnered with the Arbor
					Day Foundation to receive help with planting trees, as well as make sure they are being planted well and to
					assure they grow healthy (Team Trees/Arbor Day Foundation, 2019).</p><img src="images/yt.jpg" alt="" />
				<p>Planting and regrowing more trees ensure we
					can replenish the areas that have been affected by deforestation in many forests and parts of the world. Also,
					regrowing trees will heavily reduce, and if not, completely eliminate the climate change crisis, as the globe
					is warming, and many greenhouse gasses are being emitted into our atmosphere. The more gas that escapes to our
					atmosphere, the ozone layers will reduce and heat the globe by the smallest amount. This will cause even
					hotter summers, rising ocean levels, droughts, as well as wipe out coral reefs and melt more ice caps.
					Scientists say we have ten years to solve this climate change crisis, before we cannot go back (CNN, 2018).
					Growing more trees are the way to go, and if the whole world gets involved, we can properly address the
					climate problem in a couple of years.</p>

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The purpose of this report was to identify what the Amazon rainforest is, where it is located and why it is
					threatened and what are the repercussions of this issue. The report examined evidence, analysed proposals
					through investigating the impact on society and the environment and identified the most achievable solution to
					the problem. The Amazon rainforest spans 6.7 million square kilometres. It is currently the largest rainforest
					biome on the Earth and is twice the size of India. The Amazon is currently being threatened by deforestation
					and multiple wildfires. Since the 1950s, 17% of the Amazon's trees have been cut down to clear land for more
					livestock and other properties (World Bank, 2013). The wildfires have also been more prominent in the recent
					years, and recently there were an outburst of even more fires. At one point, more than 40,000 fires were
					burning inside the Amazon. Most wildfires were manmade and were the result of bad farming practices. The
					impact of the fires and bad farming practices is on the animals and plant life, as they are constantly losing
					more and more habitats. Consequences for losing animal and plant habitats could be endangerment or even
					extinction, as some animals can’t and won’t be able to adapt to their new environment and surroundings quickly
					enough. Section 4.1 and 4.2 both introduced recommendations to be able to fix the climate change crisis and
					reduce deforestation in the Amazon. Research was carried out to ensure accurate results and a deep analysis.
					The chosen recommendation was to plant more trees in the Amazon rainforest as well as overall on Earth.
					Companies such as One Tree Planted, Arbor Day Foundation and Team Trees are raising money to be able to buy
					and plant more trees, making sure they grow healthily and successfully, to reduce deforestation in affected
					areas. Studies have shown that growing more trees is the most effective solution, and if the whole world gets
					involved, we can properly address the climate problem in a couple of years, as we only have about ten years
					left before it becomes irreversible.</p>
